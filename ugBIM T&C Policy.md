# undergroundBIM - T&C

## undergroundBIM

Welcome to the undergroundBIM platform.  The intent of this platform is to create an underground community and  provide an open dialogue about the current state of technology within the AEC industry.  All members of this group 
have been privately invited because of their experience, knowledge and/or talent and have every right to speak their opinion on the BIM conversations at hand.

We believe that the relationships that could be forged through this platform could have a great impact on the industry, pushing ideas, solutions and the BIM industry as a whole to the max.
